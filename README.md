Algorithm and Data Structure Search Engine
Efficient search engine dedicated to algorithms and data structure problems. Instantly find coding challenges and solutions using a relevance-ranked search process.

Introduction
This project provides a specialized search engine for algorithmic problems and data structures. It streamlines searching through an extensive collection, offering fast, optimized access to coding challenges useful for interview preparation and computer science study.

Project Architecture
Core Components
Backend Server: Node.js + Express.js

Search Implementation: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

View Engine: EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating)

Database: File-based system of problem descriptions.

Key Features
Problem Database

Rich, growing collection of algorithm challenges

Organized in a searchable, indexed text system.

Fast, Relevant Search

TF-IDF-based ranking for precise results

Fast response with efficient text preprocessing.

Search Algorithm
The engine uses the TF-IDF algorithm:

T
F
-
I
D
F
(
t
,
d
,
D
)
=
T
F
(
t
,
d
)
×
I
D
F
(
t
,
D
)
TF-IDF(t,d,D)=TF(t,d)×IDF(t,D)
Where:

t
t: term

d
d: document

D
D: collection

T
F
TF: term frequency

I
D
F
IDF: inverse document frequency
.
